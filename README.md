# Bulk Forge Script Generation Tool :hammer_and_wrench:

Welcome to the **Bulk Forge Script Generation Tool** repository! This tool is designed to automate the creation of batch files or scripts based on predefined topics, utilizing prompts sent to ChatGPT for generating content. Whether you're looking to streamline your development workflow, automate system maintenance tasks, or generate a wide array of scripts, this tool offers a powerful way to create custom script lists and process them efficiently.

## How It Works :gear:

Our Bulk Forge Tool processes a text file containing a list of topics, each on a new line. It replaces the placeholder `[topic]` in a predefined prompt with each line from your text file. This allows for the bulk creation of scripts or batch files, tailored to each topic you've listed.

### Creating Your Script List

1. **Prepare Your Text File**: Create a text file where each line represents one topic you want a script for. For example, "Backup Files", "Set System Restore Point", etc.
2. **Format**: Do not include any periods (.) or numbers at the beginning of your lines. Each line should cleanly state the topic.

### Processing Your Text File with Bulk Forge Tool

1. **Access Bulk Forge Tool**: Navigate to [Bulk Forge Tool](https://bulkForge.leumas.tech).
2. **Upload Your Text File**: Use the tool's interface to upload the text file you've prepared.
3. **Set Your Prompt**: Enter the prompt that will be used for generating each script. Use `[topic]` where you want the topic from your text file to be inserted. An example prompt might be "Please create a batch file for [topic]."
4. **Generate**: Execute the process. The tool will create individual scripts for each topic in your text file, replacing `[topic]` with the actual topic name.

After processing, you will receive 100 text files if your list contained 100 topics, each file corresponding to a script generated for a topic.

## :warning: Dos and Don'ts

### Dos

- Ensure topics are relevant to the type of scripts you're aiming to generate.
- Use concise and clear topic names for best results.

- Avoid numbering your topics in the list.
- Refrain from using vague or overly broad topics.
